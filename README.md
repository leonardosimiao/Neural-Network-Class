## Introduction

The São Carlos campus of the University of São Paulo features a large array of cameras, but not enough security personnel to monitor it. 
Therefore, a system which could bring attention to cameras with possible anomalous activity could make the system more effective. 
A proof-of-concept implementation of such a system was developed based on the Inception v2 neural network, along with a system to detect 
interactions between people and objects.

## Implementation
This project uses the CNN Inception v2 using the Microsoft COCO dataset.
